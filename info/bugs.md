# Bugs:
- Need to fix html injection inside of highlight notes description table. Though, it would be nice to allow some level of HTML, for bolding, lists, headers, etc, without the possible downside of having foreign javascript messing up your day.
- Context Menu Positioning when Scrolling
- Right click should work with spellcheck 
- Not Selection not working.... again....
