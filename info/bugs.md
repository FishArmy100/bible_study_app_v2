# Bugs:
- Need to fix html injection inside of highlight notes description table. Though, it would be nice to allow some level of HTML, for bolding, lists, headers, etc, without the possible downside of having foreign javascript messing up your day.
- Next/previous chapter buttons don't reset start (also doesn't work with other stuff)
- 'undefined' text when rendering single page of button text in search results
- Not scrolling to beginning???
