# Bugs:
- Need to fix html injection inside of highlight notes description table. Though, it would be nice to allow some level of HTML, for bolding, lists, headers, etc, without the possible downside of having foreign javascript messing up your day.
- Problem with context menu not wrapping properly when near end of a page
