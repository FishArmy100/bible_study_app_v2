# Bugs:
- Need to fix html injection inside of highlight notes description table. Though, it would be nice to allow some level of HTML, for bolding, lists, headers, etc, without the possible downside of having foreign javascript messing up your day.
- Searching for spaces is valid
- Allow for some punctuation in names
- Erasing highlight after deleting it breaks chapter
  - **Note:** Hard to find
- Next/previous chapter buttons don't reset start (also doesn't work with other stuff)
- Multi chapter tabs in display (I forget what this is)
